/*
 * FriendSh3ep network process - disk cache for downloaded media.
 *
 * Avatar images, status attachment thumbnails, and custom emoji are stored
 * in a configurable directory using the FNV-1a 32-bit hash of the source
 * URL as the filename (no extension: Amiga datatypes detect JPEG/PNG from
 * magic bytes, so the extension is irrelevant and omitting it simplifies
 * cache lookup to a single Open() probe).
 *
 * Lookup/Store take an optional `subdir` (e.g. "usericons", "thumbnails")
 * so different purposes land in their own subdirectory of the cache root
 * instead of one flat pile of hash-named files -- pass NULL/"" for the old
 * flat-root behaviour (still used for anything that doesn't care, e.g.
 * custom emoji). The subdirectory is created lazily on first Store(), the
 * same recursive mkdir-p this file already does for the root.
 *
 * The cache directory is set once at Init() time and persists for the
 * lifetime of the network process.  It is created recursively if absent
 * (fs3enet_cache.c contains an AmigaOS-aware mkdir-p equivalent).
 *
 * All functions must be called from the network process task only.
