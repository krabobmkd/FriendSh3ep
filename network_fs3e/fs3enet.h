 * FS3ENETQ_TIMELINE — fetch one page of statuses for a timeline.

 * GUI can route replies back to the right TootTimeline channel.
 * fs3et_AccountGeneration is an opaque caller-defined token (FriendSh3ep
 * stamps its App.accountGeneration, bumped on every login/account switch)
 * echoed back the same way -- lets the caller tell a reply for the account
 * that was active when the request was sent apart from one for whatever
 * account is active *now*, since two FS3ENETQ_TIMELINE requests for the
 * same fs3et_ViewModeBit sent under different accounts (e.g. one still in
 * flight when the user switches accounts) are otherwise indistinguishable
 * once the reply comes back -- this process treats it as opaque and never
 * inspects it.
 * fs3et_AccessToken may be "" for public timelines.
 * fs3et_MaxId/fs3et_MinId may be NULL/empty; at most one should be set (see
 * fs3et_PageDirection) -- fs3et_MaxId asks for statuses strictly older than
 * that status id (contiguous with what the GUI already has at the bottom

 * the raw (NOT URL-encoded) search text -- FS3ENet_HandleTimeline encodes
 * it itself and folds it onto fs3et_Timeline as "&q=...". "" for every
 * other shape.
 *
 * fs3et_MinId is repurposed for FS3ENET_TLSHAPE_SINGLE_REFRESH: its normal
 * "page strictly newer than this id" pagination meaning doesn't apply to a
 * single-status fetch, so it instead carries the TTLPost.postId the GUI
 * should patch once the reply lands (see FS3ENetTimelineReply.fs3et_RefreshPostId) --
 * this can differ from the refetched status's own id in the notifications
 * view, where TTLPost.postId is the notification's own id, not the embedded
 * status's (see TTLPostSetup.notifStatusId in fs3etoottimeline.h).
