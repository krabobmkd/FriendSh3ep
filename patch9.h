/*
 * patch9.h - shared 9-slice ("patch9") background skin for BOOPSI gadgets.
 *
 * $VER: patch9.h 1.0 (03.07.2026)
 * Copyright (C) 2026 FriendSh3ep contributors. All rights reserved.
 *
 * A Patch9 wraps one BmImage holding PATCH9_NUM_STATES equal-size sub-images
 * arranged left-to-right in a single horizontal strip (index 0 leftmost).
 * Each sub-image is a 9-sliced skin: a cornerSize-pixel border kept unscaled
 * at the 4 corners, with the remaining edge/center strips tiled (repeated,
 * not stretched) to fill whatever target size Patch9_Draw() is asked for.
 *
 * Lifecycle mirrors BmImage:
 *   Patch9_Init()   -- once, copies file path, sets corner size
 *   Patch9_Load()   -- on each screen open; loads the bitmap + mask
 *   Patch9_Unload() -- on iconify / screen close
 *   Patch9_Free()   -- once at teardown
 *
 * A Patch9 instance is owned and kept alive by the application, not by any
 * gadget that references it -- UBTP9_Patch9 stores a borrowed pointer, so
 * one Patch9 (one skin) can be shared by any number of UniButtonP9 gadgets.
