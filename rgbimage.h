 * rgbimage.h - Fast-RAM 24bit RGB pixel-array image for FriendSh3ep's
 * render-path rework (see PlanToReworkThumbnails.txt steps 2-3).
 *
 * Unlike BmImage (bmimage.h), which decodes into a screen-format
 * struct BitMap via picture.datatype, RgbImage holds a plain top-down
 * RGB24 buffer in Fast RAM -- no chip-RAM struct BitMap, no
 * picture.datatype object kept alive, and no per-DPI on-disk thumbnail
 * cache: the same fixed-size source buffer is rescaled at draw time to
 * whatever size the current avatarSize needs.
 *
 * RgbImage_LoadBmp() reads the exact minimal 24bpp BI_RGB format
 * bmimage.c's BmImage_GenerateScaledBmp()/the thumbnail process (fs3ethumb.h)
 * writes, so no datatypes.library round-trip is needed to reload it -- only
 * that hand-written format is supported, not arbitrary BMP files.
