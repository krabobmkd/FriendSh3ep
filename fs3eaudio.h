/*
 * fs3eaudio.h - FriendSh3ep MP3 audio playback process.
 *
 * $VER: fs3eaudio.h 1.0 (18.07.2026)
 * Copyright (C) 2026 FriendSh3ep contributors. All rights reserved.
 *
 * Decodes MP3 (mpega.library, MPEGA_decode_frame) and streams it to
 * ahi.device with a double-buffered SendIO/WaitIO chain (ahir_Link) --
 * ported/adapted from ukonxMyWorldOS3SRC/Ukonx_MyWorld's AHISoundServer.c
 * (a generic AHI double-buffer "sound server" driven by a SoundWriter
 * callback) + AHIMPEGA.c (the MP3-specific callback). Folded into one
 * process/file here since this app only ever plays MP3 through it -- no
 * need for that project's reusable SoundWriter indirection.
 *
 * Runs entirely on its own AmigaDOS process (CreateNewProcTags, same
 * request/reply MsgPort shape as fs3ethumb.c/network_fs3e/fs3enet.c),
 * since a continuously streaming AHI double-buffer loop would otherwise
 * block the GUI task for the whole track. Control messages (PLAY/STOP/
 * SHUTDOWN) are polled non-blockingly between buffer fills -- so reacting
 * to a Stop request is bounded by one buffer's playback duration (well
 * under a second) rather than needing the tight decode/AHI loop itself
 * restructured around a multi-source Wait().
 *
 * Generic/standalone for now -- playable via FS3EAudio_Play() with any
 * local MP3 file path already on disk. Wiring this to Mastodon toot audio
 * attachments (TTL_HOT_PLAY_AUDIO) is a separate, later step.
 *
 * Toolchain note: <proto/mpega.h> does NOT compile with this project's
 * m68k-amigaos-gcc (it unconditionally #includes <pragmas/mpega_pragmas.h>,
 * which this toolchain doesn't ship -- unlike e.g. <proto/datatypes.h> or
 * <proto/ahi.h>, which both have a __GNUC__ branch to the matching header
 * under inline/ instead, mpega's proto header has no such branch).
 * fs3eaudio.c includes <clib/mpega_protos.h> + <inline/mpega.h> directly
 * instead -- the same LP-macro inline-stub mechanism proto/ahi.h itself
 * resolves to, just
 * without the wrapper that's missing the __GNUC__ check.
