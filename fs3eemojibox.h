/*
 * fs3eemojibox.h - Emoji-table popup window for FriendSh3ep.
 *
 * Forked from EmojiGear/emojibox.c/.h (same private BOOPSI grid-gadget
 * approach, rendered with utf8rastport like every other text surface in
 * this app), NOT shared with it -- adapted to FriendSh3ep's own
 * sub-window conventions (see fs3eloginview.h/fs3etootview.h: BOOL
 * _Create(view, dc) called once at startup, not lazily on first open) and
 * trimmed to what a Mastodon compose box actually needs:
 *   - dropped the ANSI escape-modifier buttons (Bold/Italic/colour...) --
 *     those insert raw terminal escape sequences that EmojiGear's own
 *     utf8rastport-based renderer interprets locally; a Mastodon toot is
 *     posted as plain UTF-8 text, so they'd just show up as literal
 *     garbage characters in a real post.
 *   - dropped the F1-F10 quick-insert shortcuts -- EmojiGear wires those
 *     through its main window's raw-key handling and an app-wide
 *     "activeEditorObj" concept neither of which FriendSh3ep has; the
 *     button-triggered popup (GID_TOOT_EMOJI_BUTTON) is the requested
 *     entry point.
 *   - insertion always targets FS3ETootView's body editor (FriendSh3ep
 *     has exactly one relevant compose field, unlike EmojiGear's
 *     multi-tab editor tracking) -- see FS3EEmojiBoxWindow_GetClickedUTF8,
 *     called from friendsh3ep.c's GID_EMOJIBOX_GRID case.
